        <h1>Just A Speedrunner</h1>
        <p>Now you may be wondering, why does this website look like it came straight out of 1996? <br>
            Well to put it simply, HTML alone is a lot easier than learning all the extra CSS and JS that comes with making a good site. <br>
            BUT that doesn't stop this site from being functional, below you can find links to all my stuff in those fancy hyperlinks &#128563;. <br>
            Also you're welcome for the dark mode, have a great day :j<br>
